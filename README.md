Landing Page
The journey to finishing this project was filled with a lot of code tweaking and trial and error.
I eventually got stuck and frustrated so I reached out to my instructor and he put me through.
After helping and providing some resources I mentioned that I had been relunctant to "bug" him and he said 
"Ha, you don't keep silent when it comes to coding o.. always google your questions and ask people around you for help"
So, thank you Sir, I was finally able to build a landing page that I hope was similar enough to yours.

Thank you for checking my repository, if there are corrections or better ways you think I could have done this please reach out at obayemigbemisola@gmail.com, I'm happy to learn.
